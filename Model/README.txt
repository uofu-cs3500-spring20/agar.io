2.5. Time keeping

I estimated that this assignment would take roughly 5 hours to implement AND bugtest (HAHA).

Session 1: 4 hours

Session 2: 4 hours

Session 3: 1 hour

Session 4: 20 mins

Session 5: 30 mins

Session 6: 45 mins

Session 7: 1 hour

Total time ~ 13 hours.


I think my estimates thus far have been pretty accurate, this one however was a little off. I think I was over confident with my ability to fully concentrate during all this free
time at home, which led to me not digesting the content very quickly. I got stuck on really stupid little things that I laugh at now; which I guess is all in the fun of learning.
